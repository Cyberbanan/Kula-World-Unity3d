# Kula-World-Unity3d
A remake of Kula World / Roll Away in Unity with In-Game Editor

(Currently incomplete game mechanics and some bugs)  

The game is designed to be played with Xbox 360 controller.

Feel free to use it especially to get an idea how to code an in-game editor in unity with load and save functions.
